# ü§ñ Machine Learning using Python  

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`machine learning.ipynb`) that demonstrates the application of **Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning algorithms** using Python.  

The goal is to explore how different ML models can be applied to real-world datasets for **classification, regression, and clustering tasks**.

## ‚ö° Example Workflow  

```python
# Import libraries
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix

# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv("dataset.csv")

# Preprocess
X = df.drop("Target", axis=1)
y = df["Target"]

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)

# Train model
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
